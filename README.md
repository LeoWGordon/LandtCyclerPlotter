# LandtCyclerPlotter
GUI to plot constant current cycling using .txt data from a Landt battery cycler. Assumes initial rest followed by alternating constant current steps.

Select file using the file browser, load the data and choose a cycle to plot into the preview (and repeat if desired). Once you're happy with the preview plot, plot to the external plot to make any final adjustments and use the save button to save a pdf figure of the plot to the same folder as the input data, with the same filename appended with .pdf.

The table will automatically populate with data from the plotted cycles, this can be copied as desired.
